    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: August 20, 2025</em></p>

    <p>
        <strong>AI Auto Invoicing</strong> and <strong>Zen Nota</strong> is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we
        collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application available on the Google Play
        Store.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We strive to minimize the personal information we collect. Here is an overview:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Data:</strong> All your invoice data, clients, and items may be stored locally on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Cloud Data:</strong> If you sign in with an account, your invoices, clients, and related information may be securely stored in
            <strong>Google Firestore</strong> to allow syncing across devices.</li>
        <li><strong>User Accounts:</strong> We use <strong>Google Firebase Authentication</strong> to manage sign-in and registration. Depending on your chosen method
            (Google, Microsoft, Facebook, or email/password), we collect basic profile information (e.g., name, email) to manage your account.</li>
        <li><strong>Payments:</strong> We do not collect your payment details directly; payments and subscriptions are
            processed securely via Google Play’s billing system.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. User Accounts and Authentication</h2>
    <p>
        Account creation and login are handled using <strong>Google Firebase Authentication</strong>. If you register or sign in using third-party providers 
        (Google, Microsoft, Facebook), authentication is securely handled by those services. We only receive and store 
        basic profile information such as your name and email to create and manage your account within the app.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your login credentials are never stored or accessed by us directly. You can manage or delete your account by
        contacting us or through account settings where available.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Payments and Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>
        Purchases such as customized templates and subscriptions are processed securely through Google Play’s payment
        system. We do not store or have access to your payment information.
    </p>
    <p>
        Donations or “Buy me a coffee” contributions are made via external platforms (e.g., BuyMeACoffee.com, Ko-fi.com, PayPal)
        through direct links. These payments are handled entirely by those third-party services, and our app does not
        process or store any payment information related to these transactions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Subscription renewals, cancellations, and refunds are managed through your Google Play account. Please refer to
        Google Play’s policies for more details.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Permissions</h2>
    <p>The app may request the following permissions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> To save invoice PDFs and other files on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Internet:</strong> For optional AI-powered features such as formatting suggestions and text
            generation, as well as syncing data with Google Firestore.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Sharing and Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        We do not sell or share your personal data with third parties for marketing purposes. However, to provide
        certain features, we use trusted third-party services:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Authentication Providers:</strong> Google Firebase Authentication (Google, Microsoft, Facebook, or email/password).</li>
        <li><strong>Database:</strong> Google Firestore for securely storing your invoice and client data when using account features.</li>
        <li><strong>Payment Processing:</strong> Google Play billing for handling payments.</li>
        <li><strong>Donations:</strong> External platforms such as BuyMeACoffee.com, Ko-fi.com, and PayPal.</li>
        <li><strong>AI Features:</strong> Optional AI APIs such as OpenAI for formatting and text generation assistance.
            These do not receive sensitive or personal data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        Our app is not intended for children under the age of 16. In certain regions, local laws may allow a lower age of digital consent (between 13 and 16). 
        We do not knowingly collect personal information from users below the applicable age of consent.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Your Rights and Controls</h2>
    <p>
        You have the right to access, update, or delete your personal information stored in the app. For account-related
        data, please contact us or use available account management options.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can manage or cancel subscriptions through your Google Play account settings.
    </p>
    <p>
        To delete all app data stored locally on your device, you can clear the app’s data via your Android device
        settings. For cloud data stored in Firestore, you may request deletion by contacting us.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally to reflect changes in our practices or for legal reasons. Any
        changes will be posted here with an updated revision date.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Rewards and Referral Credits</h2>
    <p>
        AI Auto Invoicing may offer referral programs and promotional credits. These credits are not real currency and
        can only be used within the app to unlock features or discounts. They have no cash value and are
        non-transferable.
    </p>
